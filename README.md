# Time Gated LSTM for irregular time series

This repository contain a PyTorch implementation of a variant of Vanilla LSTM in order to take into account a irregular time between time samples. The new LSTM structure (Time Gated LSTM) is based on the paper [Nonuniformly Sampled Data Processing Using LSTM Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8478179/)  by *Safa Onur Sahin* and *Suleyman Serdar Kozat*.
